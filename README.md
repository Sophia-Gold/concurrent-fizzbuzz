# concurrent-fizzbuzz.clj
...your favorite demeaning technical interview question implemented with Clojure's [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) library.

Although the choice of content places it in a tongue-in-cheek lineage with those such as [TensorFlow fizz buzz](http://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/) this began as an exercise for me to learn core.async, an implementation of Tony Hoare's [Communicating Sequential Processes](http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf) almost exactly the same as that in Google's Go language.
